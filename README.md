### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Sharad Sisodiya
## About me
I am an Artificial Intelligence student at Vivekanada Global University since 2021. I am passionate about data science and continuously learning new skills and techniques to become a successful data scientist.

My GitHub repository contains a wide range of projects, from simple examples to complex applications, all designed to help learners of all levels. Through my projects, I aim to showcase my skills and knowledge in data science and share my experiences with the community.

I am proficient in various programming languages and tools, including Python, SQL, and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. I also have experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau and matplotlib.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and team player. I believe that collaboration and communication are key to achieving success in any project. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others in the data science community.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you and contributing to the open-source community!"
